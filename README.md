# react-starter

This is the template I use to start my React projects.

## It contains
* Default project setup with create-react-app.
* Tailwind setup.
* Added `.env` file with `BROWSER=none` to prevent `npm start` from opening the browser.
* Set `homepage` and added `predeploy` and `deploy` commands in `package.json`.
* Deleted `App.css` and `logo.svg`.
* Indented everything with Tabs, removed comments.
* Edited and cleaned `App.js` to show the below page.
